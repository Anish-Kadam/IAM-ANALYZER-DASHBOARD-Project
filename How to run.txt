# 🔐 IAM Analyzer & Reporting Dashboard

> 📊 A simple, beginner-friendly AWS IAM auditing tool that shows who has admin access, old access keys, and risky policies — all in a clean, interactive dashboard.

---

## 🧠 What is this project?

This is a cloud security tool built using **Python**, **AWS IAM**, and **Streamlit** that helps you **visually audit your AWS IAM environment**.

It automatically scans and displays:

* 👤 List of all IAM users
* 🛡️ Attached and inline policies
* ⚠️ Users with **AdministratorAccess**
* 🔑 Access key age and status
* 🚨 Inline policies and risky permissions

This helps AWS users follow **least privilege** best practices and detect common IAM misconfigurations.
